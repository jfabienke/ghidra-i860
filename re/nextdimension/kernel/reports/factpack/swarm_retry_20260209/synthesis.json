All 11 functions exhibit zero incoming call edges, preventing static determination of entry conditions. The dominant pattern is indirect branch (bri) through runtime-computed targets (r2, r3) classified as 'dynamic_entry' by Phase 2 analysis, confirming that dispatch addresses are ALU-chain computed and unresolvable without emulation. The absence of PostScript dispatch signatures (r15 GState, xorh 0x10c6 hash, and 0xe827 classify) and MMIO token reads (0x401C) outside isolated test sequences suggests these functions are not integrated into the primary threaded interpreter control flow. High sink-register write density (70-95% of instructions to r0/f0) combined with missing return mechanisms indicates these are either: (1) compiler/linker artifacts from dead code elimination failures, (2) embedded diagnostic stubs stripped from production call graph, or (3) corrupted disassembly boundaries at fat binary construction seams (m68k/x86 object overlap at 0x017CB8, 0x03DCB8, 0x05DCB8). The firmware's execution model remains opaque at this coverage level (1.4% of binary, 60/unknown total functions).",
