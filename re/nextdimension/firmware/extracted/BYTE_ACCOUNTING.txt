Input size: 795464 bytes

Header bytes before __TEXT segment: 840
__TEXT segment bytes: 737280
Gap bytes between __TEXT and __DATA file ranges: 0
__DATA segment bytes: 57344
Trailing bytes after __DATA segment: 0
Accounted total: 795464

Byte accounting: OK (100% of bytes accounted for)

Clean window request: 0x31000 (200704 bytes)
Clean window extracted: 200704 bytes
Post-clean __TEXT remainder: 529736 bytes

Notes:
- __DATA extraction covers initialized data from file-backed __data only.
- Runtime BSS/common structures are zero-init and not present as initialized bytes.
- Clean-window extraction is a convenience slice and does NOT prove absence/presence of i860 code outside that window.
