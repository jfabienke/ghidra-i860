# NeXTdimension Firmware Lives On Through Preservation

The NeXTdimension graphics board firmware has been successfully preserved and is available today, though the original filesystem locations and detailed loading mechanisms were intentionally undocumented by NeXT Computer Inc. **The firmware exists primarily as a ~5.75 KiB ROM image** that has been extracted, archived, and is actively used in emulation. While NeXT designed the NeXTdimension as a closed system with limited user-level documentation, the vintage computing community has successfully reverse-engineered enough functionality to recreate the hardware through the Previous emulator, making this rare color graphics system accessible without physical hardware.

The NeXTdimension was an expansion card featuring an Intel i860 RISC processor running at 33 MHz with its own stripped-down Mach microkernel, designed to provide 32-bit color graphics at 1120x832 resolution. Announced in August 1990 and shipping in April 1991 for $3,995, it represented NeXT's ambitious attempt to offload graphics processing to a dedicated processor, though the original vision of running Display PostScript entirely on the i860 was never completed.

## Firmware files exist but paths remain undocumented

Official NeXT documentation intentionally omitted specific firmware file names and filesystem locations, consistent with the company's decision to keep the NeXTdimension system closed to third-party development. The board relied on **two distinct firmware components**: on-board ROM containing bootstrap code (approximately 5.75 KiB), and software driver packages distributed with NeXTSTEP releases.

The NeXTdimension software was distributed as Installer packages (.pkg format) that were "pre-installed by our factory on new NeXT computers when the NeXTdimension board is installed" according to the NeXTSTEP Release 3.3 Installation and Configuration Manual. Based on NeXTSTEP filesystem architecture, these packages likely installed to standard system directories including `/NextLibrary/`, `/NextAdmin/`, `/usr/lib/`, or `/System/Library/`. Package receipts would have been stored in `/NextLibrary/Packages/Standard/`, though specific firmware file names like hypothetical "nd.bootx" or "ND_Mach" could not be verified in accessible documentation.

The ROM component contained bootstrap code for i860 processor initialization and hardware detection, while the software packages included the stripped-down Mach kernel (informally called "GaCK OS" in developer discussions), device drivers, and Window Server components for NeXTSTEP integration. Forum discussions on nextcomputers.org reference searches for "NeXTdimension ROM image," suggesting the critical firmware components were ROM-based rather than filesystem-based updatable firmware.

## Preserved ROM images available through multiple archives

NeXTdimension firmware has been successfully preserved and is publicly available today. The **primary source is Macintosh Repository** (https://www.macintoshrepository.org/52628-next-hardware-roms), which hosts a complete set of NeXT hardware ROMs including the NeXTdimension ROM as a 5.75 KiB compressed file. These ROM files have been tested and confirmed functional with the Previous emulator, uploaded by community member skyethesudoer with thanks to that-ben for providing the original ROM dumps.

Additional preservation locations include **nextcomputers.org** (https://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/), which maintains NeXTSTEP software collections, diagnostic utilities specifically for the NeXTdimension board, and hardware documentation. The **Internet Archive** hosts NeXTSTEP installation media including versions 3.3 Developer ISOs and complete OS distributions that contain the NeXTdimension software packages. Historic FTP archives at **ftp.funet.fi/pub/NeXT/** preserve NeXT software dating back to the early internet era, while **WinWorldPC** maintains NeXTSTEP OS versions 0.x through 4.x.

The ROM files represent static hardware firmware rather than regularly updated software, with no evidence of multiple distinct ROM versions in preserved archives. The software driver components evolved across NeXTSTEP releases, but the core ROM remained consistent throughout the product's lifetime.

## Boot process involved dual initialization sequence

The NeXTdimension firmware loading during NeXTSTEP boot followed a multi-stage process that initialized both the main 68040 processor system and the separate i860 graphics processor. When the NeXT computer powered on, the system ROM first initialized the main 68040 CPU, then detected the presence of NeXTdimension cards in NeXTBus expansion slots.

Upon detection, **the NeXTdimension's on-board ROM provided bootstrap code** that initialized the i860 processor, performed hardware self-tests, detected and sized memory (8-64 MB RAM and 4 MB VRAM), and established communication protocols with the main system. The i860 then loaded its stripped-down Mach microkernel, set up virtual memory, initialized device drivers, and configured the graphics subsystem. The kernel cleared VRAM, programmed the RAMDAC for output timing to achieve 1120x832 resolution at 32 bits per pixel, and created shared memory regions for communication with the 68040.

The board operated semi-autonomously after initialization, running its own Mach kernel in parallel with the main NeXTSTEP system. The firmware established NeXTBus communication protocols and interrupt handlers to enable the 68040 to send graphics commands to the i860 for pixel manipulation and framebuffer operations. According to community documentation, **NeXTSTEP Release 2.1 or higher was required** to use the NeXTdimension, with the NeXTdimension Installer package providing necessary Window Server integration.

Previous emulator documentation reveals implementation details: the i860 runs in a separate thread during emulation, requiring careful synchronization between the two processors. Versions 1.5 and 1.6 of Previous fixed threading bugs and external interrupt timing issues that caused the NeXTdimension to fail or not stop properly, suggesting the real hardware had complex inter-processor coordination requirements.

## Software evolved but ROM remained static

Version history for NeXTdimension firmware presents an unusual picture: while **software driver packages evolved significantly across NeXTSTEP releases, the ROM firmware appears to have been a single static version** throughout the product's lifetime. No documentation of distinct ROM version numbers (such as "v1.0," "v2.0") has been found in preserved archives, technical forums, or community discussions.

The software components showed clear evolution tied to NeXTSTEP releases. **NeXTSTEP 2.1** introduced original NeXTdimension support with PostScript version 2.1.55.4 (versus 2.1.55.3 without the NeXTdimension package). **NeXTSTEP 3.0 through 3.1** continued support with Video API changes. **NeXTSTEP 3.2** represented a significant milestone, adding 32-bit color support that improved performance compared to earlier implementations. **NeXTSTEP 3.3**, released in 1994, provided the final official NeXTdimension support before NeXT's transition to OPENSTEP and eventual focus on software-only solutions.

Technical documentation indicates that ROM Rev. 2.0 for NeXTcube/NeXTstation motherboards introduced NeXTdimension support capability, but this refers to the main system ROM rather than the NeXTdimension's own firmware. The lack of version differentiation in the ~5.75 KiB ROM file suggests NeXT shipped a mature, stable firmware that required no updates throughout the product lifecycle from 1991 to approximately 1995.

NeXTanswers documentation (#1036 "The NeXTdimension Software" and #1037 "NeXTdimension Upgrades") provided guidance on software packages but made no mention of ROM updates or multiple firmware versions. The "NeXTdimension Compendium" compiled by the community in 1993 similarly documented software configuration and usage without referencing firmware versioning.

## Previous emulator achieved remarkable reverse engineering success

The most significant reverse engineering accomplishment for NeXTdimension firmware came through the **Previous emulator project**, which added NeXTdimension support in version 1.4 released in February 2016. Led by Andreas Grabher, Simon Schubiger, and Gilles Fetis, this open-source project successfully recreated NeXTdimension functionality without access to original source code or detailed firmware specifications, relying instead on behavioral observation and preserved ROM images.

The breakthrough came from **integrating Jason Eckhardt's i860 processor emulator**, originally developed for the MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) project. Simon Schubiger improved and completed portions of this i860 emulator specifically for NeXTdimension support, implementing the 64-bit RISC architecture at 33 MHz with control registers, integer and floating-point units, and graphics operations. Version 1.7 added SoftFloat library integration for accurate floating-point emulation, while version 2.0 enhanced support to handle up to three NeXTdimension cards simultaneously, matching the real hardware's maximum configuration.

The emulator's development history reveals technical challenges and solutions. Version 1.5 fixed threading bugs causing the NeXTdimension to fail after disabling threads. Version 1.6 addressed bugs preventing proper stopping behavior and fixed external i860 interrupt delay issues while improving RAMDAC emulation. The emulator achieves "good" status for core functionality including 32-bit color graphics output, memory emulation, multi-threaded execution, and dual-monitor configurations, though **video I/O (S-Video input/output) remains unimplemented** and the system does not work on big-endian hosts.

Despite these achievements, **no documented attempts to disassemble or decompile the ROM firmware** exist in community archives. No source code leaks have occurred, and detailed protocol documentation for NeXTBus communication, hardware register specifications, or the internal structure of the "GaCK" Mach kernel remain undocumented. The emulation succeeds through behavioral approximation rather than complete low-level accuracy, sufficient for running original NeXTSTEP software with NeXTdimension support.

Community forums on nextcomputers.org, particularly the thread titled "NeXTdimension ROM image" started by Previous developer Andreas Grabher in June 2015, documented the ROM preservation effort. The Vintage Computer Federation forums host hardware troubleshooting discussions revealing common issues like NBIC (NeXTBus Interface Chip) failures, component-level diagnostics, and LED flash patterns indicating problems—practical knowledge that informed emulation development but didn't constitute formal reverse engineering.

## Technical specifications reveal sophisticated but incomplete design

The NeXTdimension firmware managed sophisticated hardware with a theoretical design that exceeded what shipped in production. The board featured an **Intel i860 64-bit RISC processor running at 33 MHz**, an ambitious choice given the i860's notorious difficulty for both programming and emulation due to program-accessible pipelines requiring compiler-level instruction scheduling and complex cache coherency requirements.

The firmware controlled 8-32 MB of main RAM expandable via eight 72-pin SIMM slots and 4 MB of VRAM, supporting resolution of **1120x832 pixels at 24-bit color plus 8-bit alpha channel**. The ROM image binary format consumed approximately 5.75 KiB, containing bootstrap code, hardware initialization sequences, memory detection routines, and the framework for loading the Mach microkernel. While the exact binary structure has not been publicly documented, the firmware's function is well understood: it provided i860 processor initialization, established NeXTBus communication, configured graphics output through DB13W3 RGB connectors, and managed the semi-autonomous operation of the i860 running its own operating system.

The firmware's intended functionality differed significantly from what shipped. NeXT originally planned for the i860 to run **Display PostScript rendering entirely on the graphics processor**, which would have dramatically accelerated graphics operations. This functionality was never completed, and according to community documentation, the i860 ended up "just moving color pixels around" rather than performing sophisticated PostScript interpretation. The board included a connector for a C-Cube CL550 compression chip that would have enabled hardware MJPEG compression for video I/O at 640x480, 30 fps, but this chip was dropped due to three-month delivery delays and few compression daughterboards were ever manufactured.

The firmware managed power consumption of 25 watts, coordinated interrupt handling between the 68040 and i860 processors, and implemented DMA operations for efficient data transfer. Memory architecture included shared regions between the two processors, requiring careful synchronization that Previous emulator versions 1.5 and 1.6 had to debug. The RAMDAC (Random Access Memory Digital-to-Analog Converter) received control signals from the firmware to generate proper display timing, though emulation implements only "dummy" basic functionality rather than cycle-accurate behavior.

## Documentation scattered across preservation efforts

Authoritative documentation about NeXTdimension firmware exists in fragmented form across multiple preservation efforts, combining official NeXT materials with community-created resources. **Official NeXT Computer Inc. documentation** available through bitsavers.org includes "Installing and Configuring NeXTSTEP Release 3.3 1994.pdf," which describes Installer package installation procedures, system requirements (NeXTSTEP 2.1+), and factory pre-installation processes. The official "NeXTDIMENSION.pdf" product brochure from 1992 provides hardware specifications but lacks firmware implementation details.

NeXT's **NeXTanswers knowledge base articles** (#1036 "The NeXTdimension Software" and #1037 "NeXTdimension Upgrades") offered guidance on software installation and configuration but maintained the company's policy of not documenting low-level firmware details. The Computer History Museum may possess additional NeXT internal engineering documents that have not been digitized or made publicly available.

Community-created documentation proved essential for understanding practical implementation. **"The NeXTdimension Compendium"** compiled in 1993 and preserved at https://www.vamp.org/next/nd-faq.txt represents the most comprehensive user-facing documentation, covering memory configuration recommendations, performance characteristics, two-headed display setups, Turbo motherboard compatibility, and software compatibility issues. This document aggregated knowledge from comp.sys.next mailing lists where engineers and users shared practical experiences.

The **Previous emulator documentation** at https://previous.unixdude.net/ and in the project's readme.previous.txt file provides modern technical analysis of emulation requirements, ROM file specifications, hardware behavior, and implementation status. This represents reverse-engineered understanding of firmware functionality based on behavioral observation rather than access to original specifications. **Source code repositories** on GitHub (probonopd/previous, itomato/Previous) and SourceForge contain implementation details in C code, showing how i860 emulation, memory management, graphics handling, and NeXTBus interface work in practice.

Archive.org hosts NeXTSTEP installation media and software collections that contain the actual Installer packages with NeXTdimension drivers, allowing researchers to extract and examine distributed software components. Forums at nextcomputers.org maintain active discussions with diagnostic utilities at http://www.nextcomputers.org/NeXTfiles/Software/Diagnostic_Utilities/DimensionBoard/ and hardware documentation sections. Usenet archives via Google Groups (comp.sys.next.hardware, comp.sys.next.misc) preserve historical technical discussions from the 1990s when NeXT engineers participated in community forums.

Notable absences include detailed memory maps, complete NeXTBus protocol specifications, the internal structure of the GaCK Mach kernel, hardware register documentation, and initialization sequence flowcharts—information that likely existed only in proprietary NeXT engineering documents. The intentional lack of documentation reflected NeXT's decision to keep the i860 closed to third-party development, avoiding the need to produce development tools, extensive documentation, and support infrastructure while preventing third-party code from potentially corrupting PostScript and RenderMan implementations.

## Conclusion

The NeXTdimension graphics board firmware represents a successful preservation story within vintage computing despite NeXT's closed-system approach. The approximately 5.75 KiB ROM has been extracted, archived at Macintosh Repository and other preservation sites, and confirmed functional through the Previous emulator project. While exact filesystem locations for software components remain undocumented in official materials, the ROM images and NeXTSTEP Installer packages are accessible to researchers and enthusiasts today.

The firmware's technical implementation—a stripped-down Mach microkernel running on an Intel i860 processor with sophisticated boot sequencing and inter-processor communication—has been successfully reverse-engineered through emulation efforts led by Andreas Grabher and the Previous team. Though detailed specifications remain unavailable, the functional emulation enables running original NeXTSTEP software with color graphics support, preserving this rare computing experience for future study.

The static nature of ROM versioning, combined with evolving software packages across NeXTSTEP 2.1 through 3.3, reflects NeXT's mature firmware design that required no field updates throughout the product's 1991-1995 commercial lifetime. Documentation exists across bitsavers.org official manuals, community-compiled resources like the NeXTdimension Compendium, active forums at nextcomputers.org, and emulator source code—collectively providing comprehensive knowledge about a graphics system that, despite shipping with incomplete promised features, successfully brought 32-bit color to the NeXT platform.
